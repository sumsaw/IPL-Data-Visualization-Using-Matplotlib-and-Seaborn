# IPL-Data-Visualization-Using-Matplotlib-and-Seaborn<br>
This project is my attempt to understand and explore the Indian Premium League Data on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata <br>

# Context<br>
Indian Premier League (IPL) is a Twenty20 cricket format league in India. It is usually played in April and May every year. As of 2019, the title sponsor of the game is Vivo. The league was founded by Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) in 2008.

The Kaggle link consits of two dataset  __Deliveries and Matches__ . In this repo I will explore only the matches.csv dataset and draw insights from it using Matplotlib and Seaborn visulaization libraries in python 

# Key Challenges <br>

This data was pretty neat by itself . The only challange I faces here was. <br>
>Handling Mising Values which I imputed from my knowledge of the tournament and Google search. <br>
>Combining/Correcting team names which have changed over the years .  <br>

# Please have look at the notebook for the detailed graphs
